    <pre>     Despite billions of dollars in additional weapons and security
            assistance that NATO announced this week, allied officials said
            Ukraine would not be ready to launch a dramatic counteroffensive
            or retake large swaths of territory from Russia until next year. 

            Donations of missiles, combat vehicles, ammunition and air defenses
            from the United States and European countries will take weeks, if
            not months, to reach the front lines. 
            
            Some of the newly committed weapons have not yet been bought or built. 
            
            Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken said long-anticipated F-16s fighter
            jets would be delivered to Ukraine this summer. But even then, they might
            be used mostly defensively, as allies debated on the sidelines of the NATO
            summit in Washington whether the warplanes could fly into Russian airspace to attack. 
            
            “On many occasions, you could see that we can decide, but unfortunately we cannot deliver
            efficiently,” President Gitanas Nauseda of Lithuania said in a brief interview on Wednesday. 
            “This is a huge disappointment for me personally, because Ukrainians are expecting that 
            those goods will come, this military equipment will reach Ukraine, but it's not happening.”

    <pre>The Biden administration will soon permanently shut down the
        star-crossed $230 million temporary pier that the U.S. military built to
        rush humanitarian aid to Gaza, American officials said on Thursday.

        “I do anticipate that in relatively short order, we will wind down
        pier operations,” Jake Sullivan, President Biden's national security
        adviser, told reporters.
        
        On Wednesday, personnel from the military's Central Command attempted
        and failed to reattach the makeshift pier to the beach in Gaza after
        roughseas forced operators to remove the structure several days ago
        to avoid damage, the Pentagon said.
        
        In a statement, Maj. Gen. Patrick S. Ryder, the Pentagon press secretary,
        said the latest effort to re-anchor the pier failed because of
        “technical and weather-related issues,” recurring problems that
        The New York Times identified last month when it reported that military officials
        had warned aid organizations that the project could be dismantled as early as July.

        <pre class="headerss">4.</pre> <center><pre class="headerss">Scientists want the Paris Olympics to dump Toyota's Mirai as an official car. Here's why</pre></center>
        <center><img class="img" src="https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-1241294460.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_653,w_1160,c_fill/f_webp" alt="">
    <pre>A group of 120 scientists, engineers and academics have penned an open letter
        calling on the Paris Olympics organizers to ditch Toyota's Mirai as the official
        vehicle of the Games, saying the hydrogen-powered car undermines the event's green
        credentials.
        
        Cars that run on hydrogen emit zero carbon at the tailpipe, but 96% of the world's
        hydrogen is still derived from fossil fuels like methane gas. That makes most
        hydrogen-powered cars much more polluting than battery electric vehicles, or EVs,
        and only marginally cleaner than traditional combustion engine cars.
        
        Toyota is supplying the Game's official fleet, which includes 500 Mirai cars and
        10 coaches that run on hydrogen, as well as 1,150 EVs, to ferry athletes around.
        It says it will run the Mirais on hydrogen derived from water and organic matter,
        generated with renewable sources.
        
        But the letter's authors still oppose the car's promotion, because in reality,
        consumers who buy the Mirai will almost certainly run it on hydrogen derived from
        planet-heating fossil fuels.
        
        “We are writing to express our concern that Toyota;s promotion of a hydrogen car
        is scientifically misaligned with net-zero and will damage the reputation of the 2024 Games,” 
        wrote the authors, who include scientists and engineers from the University of Cambridge,
        Oxford University and the University of Colorado.
        
        “Opportunity remains to reroute, and we urge that you require Toyota to replace the Mirai
        with a Battery Electric Vehicle as the official Games vehicle.”
        
        The Paris Olympics organizers are aiming to host the “greenest-ever Games,” hoping to
        halve the carbon footprint of the major sporting event, compared with levels in the 2010s.
        To do that, it will attempt to run the Games entirely on renewable energy.

        <center><img class="img" src="https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/2024-07-05t173514z-609521099-rc24p8a9wabv-rtrmadp-3-india-ambani-wedding.jpg?q=w_2000,c_fill/f_webp" alt="">
    <pre>For better or for worse, days-long wedding events have become common in cultures
        around the    world. Between Friday night cocktail receptions and sore-headed Sunday
         brunches, what might once have been a half-day affair can now easily envelop three
         or four days.
 
         But a wedding that spans seven months is an outlier — even in the extravagant world of big 
         Indian weddings.
        
        On Friday, Anant Ambani — the youngest son of Mukesh Ambani, the head of India's largest
        private sector corporation, with an estimated net worth of over $122 billion, according to 
        Forbes — and pharmaceutical heiress Radhika Merchant will finally be married. The couple have
        been celebrating their betrothal since January, averaging an event every six weeks. 
        
        From a star-studded engagement party to performances by the likes of Rihanna and Justin
        Bieber, no expense has been spared. If you've lost track of where the Ambanis are at
        with their nuptial celebrations, and what lavish bashes have already taken place,
        read on for a full timeline of what's expected to be the wedding of the year..

        <center><img class="img" src="https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/2024-07-04-15-11-33-20240711124401687.jpg?q=w_1110,c_fill/f_webp" alt="">
    <pre>The camp offered typical summer activities like beach outings and sandcastle-building
        competitions but also included peculiar rituals. Campers were required to wake 
        at 6 a.m. and clean statues of former North Korean leaders Kim Il Sung and
        Kim Jong Il, even though professionals already maintained the monuments.

        Having reported from North Korea 19 times, I find Frolov's experiences both
        relatable and eye-opening. The heavy emphasis on propaganda, the strict supervision,
        and the bizarre mix of freedom and control are aspects I've encountered repeatedly.
        
        One of the more bizarre activities at the summer camp involved a computer game
         where players, asa hamster in a tank, had to destroy the White House. 
        
        This game reminded me of an exchange I had with two North Korean campers playing
        a similar game. When I asked who they were shooting, they responded, “Our sworn enemy,
        Americans.” I then asked, “What if I told you I'm an American? Do you want to shoot me too?”
        Without hesitation, they replied, “Yes.” After reassuring the youngsters 
        I was a “good American,” they decided I should be allowed to live. And then they
        smiled and  waved as we said goodbye.
